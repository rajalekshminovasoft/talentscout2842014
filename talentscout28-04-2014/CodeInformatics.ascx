                            In recent years, HR functions have gained considerable strategic importance. 
                            There is a growing realization that the labor force is the most valuable asset 
                            that adds value to organization’s strategic ambitions. Employees are the direct 
                            point of contact with the customer, product or service provided, and they decide 
                            the future of an organization.</td>

                            Leveraging this great source of potential has always been at the center of HRM
                discussions, but such discussions almost always failed to result in measurable 
                outcomes, which could otherwise convince top managements on its merit. This is 
                indeed a paradoxical situation.</td>

                Both management theorists and HRM experts are in consensus on the need to revamp 
                and restructure conventional HR departments. However, strategic managements 
                hesitate to invest heavily on such restructuring efforts, as they are still not 
                convinced enough on the possible returns. </td>

                Such an approach-avoidance conflict as evidenced from management’s conducts is 
                due to the basic lack of trust in available methodologies and processes to 
                identify, measure, and develop the dynamic potential of human resource. Current 
                HR intervention practices are mostly based on a compartmentalized view of 
                problems, devoid of a systemic or systems approach. Their outcomes often turn 
                out to be less than effective in impressing strategic management teams.</td>
