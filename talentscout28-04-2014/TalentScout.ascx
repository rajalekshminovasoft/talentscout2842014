                ability/aptitude and personality test items under 150+ assessment variables. 
                Each variable has sub-variables; each sub-variable has items with varying 
                difficulty levels. Item mapping and development is based on the IGT (<span 
                    class="style3">Item Generation Theory</span>) methodology, ensuring 
                construct and content validity of test items. IGT is the latest generation test 
                development methodology and supersedes IRT (Item Response Theory) and CTT 
                (Classic Test Theory). Every test item developed through IGT receives a path 
                code, which is verified and validated at different levels. This process 
                establishes the item-variable relationship and renders the items thus developed 
                valid and reliable. Measures of internal consistency for these items are shown 
                to be very high.
