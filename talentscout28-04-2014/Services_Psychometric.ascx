                            The effectiveness of assessments depends solely on their validity and 
                            reliability in accurately assessing what they are supposed to assess. Career 
                            Judge provides professional consultation to organizations in improving the 
                            quality of assessments/tests already in use and in developing new tests with 
                            sound psychometric properties. Psychometric services include test item analysis 
                            and calibration, test validation, standardization, norm setting and

                            basic requirement for a good test is to have psychometrically valid test items 
                            in it. Only such tests make meaningful assessments possible Conversely, tests 
                            which have psychometrically unsound items are futile and wasteful. Our experts 
                            perform item/test analyses (CTT-based analysis) to predict the effectiveness of 
                            test questions. They provide feedback reports to question authors about the 
                            psychometric properties of a question and suggest ways to modify/create 
                            questions. Analyses include:</td>
